A software engineer who would like to travel and join a team of like-minded developers. A creative engineer with more than two years of work experience in building and maintaining real-time data processing projects.

I dream of building handy applications at home. Also, I'd like to play video games, make DIY things, and watch sci-fi and fantasy stuff. If you need any help regarding any of my articles do drop a comment
instead sending me e-mails.

Thanks for showing interest. Go away now. Bye!
