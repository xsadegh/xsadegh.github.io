I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel
like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore.
It's kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at
least mean something.

Also It is a better place to write about personal experiences about non tech
stuff and I don't have to worry about too much for the content. I seriously think the media in Iran is not
representing different angles to a problem. All I hear is only two sides
where as there could be thousands of views and perspectives to any problem.
